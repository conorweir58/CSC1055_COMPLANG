TEXT FILE FOR RANDOM IDEAS FOR FSA ASSIGNMENT - JAVA

Use 4 pillars:
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

Break up files by use and compile all together

Keep it to one class per file

Getters + Setters - Encapsulation

Use your design patterns like controller

Classes:
    - State Class
    - Transition Class
    - FSA Class (Controller Class)

Design Pattern: State Pattern
    - Like a Finite State Machine anyways

TO DO LIST:
- Revise error handling in fsa methods
- Test Closure and Next more in depth
- Add messages to each function to output what is happening to the terminal
- ADD IN COMMENTS FOR WHERE EACH OOP PRINCPLE IS USED
- test deterministic more after implementing to DFA
